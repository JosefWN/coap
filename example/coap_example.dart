// The example usages for this package are split between this directory and
// its testserver-example subdirectory.
// This directory contains examples showing basic usage such as ping, discover, put/post etc. and raw request
// handling using the coap.me test server.
//
// The testserver-example directory contains a .NET based CoAP server that can
// be used for testing purposes on a Windows platform. The test server attaches
// itself to localhost on both IPV4 and IPV6 interfaces and is started
// using the net40server.bat file.
//
// The testserver-example directory also contains a README describing
// the resources supported by the server, of particular note is the
// time_obs_resource example, this shows how query an endpoint for
// observable resources and listen for the observed updates.
//
// A reasonable starting point are the ping examples.
